Django projects are pre-configured with a 'django.contrib.staticfiles' app installed for the purpose of serving static files.

If you look at the bottom of settings.py, there is a STATIC_URL = 'static/' variable that declares the name of the folder that will contain static files within a Django app.

Although Djangoâ€™s URL-based routing doesnâ€™t follow the RESTful routing methodology, we can still rely on our training thus far and use similar paths when possible.


 It is necessary to clarify that DTL is not technically a programming language, it is a templating language - like HTML or EJS. A templating language is a tool used to specify placeholders and a structure for how information will be presented (or processed) by another process.
